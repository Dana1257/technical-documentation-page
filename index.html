        <header><h2>Strings</h2></header>
        <p>A string is a sequence of one or more characters that may include letters, numbers, or symbols.</p>
        <p>A string is used to store, manipulate, and concatenate values:</p>
        <p>Concatenate means to join 2 or more strings together using the + sign.</p>
        <p>The extra space after the name <i>Bart</i> creates a space between the first name and the last name.</p>
        <code>
          <pre>
        <span><b>Example:</b></span>

            let firstName = "Bart "
            let lastName = "Simpson"
            console.log(firstName + lastName) // Bart Simpson
           </pre>
       </code>
       <ul>
           <li>Strings can use single or double quotes</li>
           <li>The start and end quotes need to be the same.</li>
           <li>If there already quotes in the string or an apostrophe use opposite syntax (the other type of quotes)</li>
       </ul>
       <code>
        <pre>
        <span><b>Examples:</b></span>

            let firstName = "Bart' // Will not work 
            let firstName = "Bart" // Works
            let example ='Don't walk' // Will not work
            let example ="Don't walk" // Works
            let example ='Don\'t walk' // Also works using the backslash (\) before the apostrophe as an escape character

        <header><h2>If Else</h2></header>
        <p>An if else statement states that if a certain condition is true a certain action will happen or if it's false another action will happen.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Whatever is between the curly brackets will be translated to a boolean (true or false)</li>
            <li>If the first statement is true it is executed, if it is false the second statement is excuted</li>

        <header><h2>Switch Statements</h2></header>
    <p> A switch statement is used to replace long if/else statements (if/else statements with more than 4 or 5 values).</p>
    <p>If the expression matches value 1 the code that matches value 1 will be executed. If the expression matches value 2  the code that matches value 2 will be executed.</p>
    <p>A break after each piece of code is mandatory otherwise the next case(s) will be executed until there is a break. In the example below if there is no break after September, the next month October will be executed. </p>
    <ul>
       <li>In the example below if it's September the console will show September and when it is October the console will automatically show October. There is no need to do anything else in this case.</li>

    <ul>
       <li>A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a specific task (Source: w3schools.com).</li>
       <li>A Javascript function is executed when is is invoked (gets called) (Source: w3schools.com).</li>
    </ul>
    <code>
         <pre>
         <span><b>Example:</b></span>
        
            function multiply (a,b){
                console.log(a * b)
             }
            
             multiply (2,3)
             multiply(8,3)
            // 6 
            // 24
       </pre>
    </code>
    <p>In the above example the function keyword is declared. Followed by the name of the function (multiply). In parentheses are the parameters; which may have names separated by commas. The code that needs to be executed by the function is placed inside curly brackets. In the example the function is executed  when the name of the function and the arguments in the parentheses are invoked (gets called).</p>
    <p>Functions also have a return keyword that ends the function and returns the value so we can store and use the result. In other words the return keyword completes the function and sends back the value that comes back after return to where it was called. With console.log it is not possible to do that because the result is not stored in the function because it is not sent back to where it was called </p>

            return x * x
            }

            let result = squared(4);

            // 16
            // 256
      </pre>

      <ul>
         <li>In the example above we used the result (16) and multiplied it by itself. </li>
